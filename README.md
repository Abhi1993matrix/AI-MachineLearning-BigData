Capability of human mind to have a vision to see far into future and predict a outcome is always been the nectar of the evolution of Human .

Every mind born, have the capability to achieve the same, and do the same in daily basis unknown to them. How to to tap into it depends upon how we engage our mind and what information we play with into.

Over here I have added few core papers, Domian Specifice R & D papers and Code(More to come) which could help the readers and users to start engaging in Field
of AI.

Attaching the BLOG Links from my Collegue which could introduce to Tools and Concepts used in Field :
